# Lab repository

On weeks with homework, the lab is usually the first part of the homework and distributed in the homework repository.
On the happy weeks with no homework, the labs will be distributed through this repository.

The labs should run without crashing as-is. However, you'll need to fill in code to make them produce the right answers.
